    <h3>The Pirates of Penzance</h3>

    <h4>ACT I
        Scene.-A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
        distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
        Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
        cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
        natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
        curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
        some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
        one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
        seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
        kneels at his feet.</h4>

    <pre>
      FREDERIC: To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave
            you for ever.
  KING:     But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at
            scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never
            shipped a handspike.
  FREDERIC: Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my
            duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty.
            As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band.
            It was through an error — no matter, the mistake was
            ours, not yours, and I was in honour bound by it.
  SAMUEL:   An error?  What error?  (RUTH rises and comes forward)
  FREDERIC: I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved
            Ruth.
  RUTH:     Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the
            cankering tooth of mystery.  Better have it out at
            once.

                            SONG — RUTH

  RUTH:     When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
                 daring,
            His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
                 seafaring.
            I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
            To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
                 pilot —
            A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
                 high lot,
            Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
                 boy a pilot.
            I was a stupid nurs'rymaid, on breakers always
                 steering,
            And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard
                 of hearing;
            Mistaking my instructions, which within my brain did
                 gyrate,
            I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a
                 pirate.
            A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile
                 lot.
            I bound him to a pirate — you! — instead of to a
                 pilot.
            I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this
                 disaster,
            But I hadn't the face to return to my place, and break
                 it to my master.
            A nurs'rymaid is not afraid of what you people call
                 work,
            So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid-
                 of-all-work.
            And that is how you find me now, a member of your shy
                 lot,
            Which you wouldn't have found, had he been bound
                 apprentice to a pilot.
  RUTH:     Oh, pardon!  Frederic, pardon!  (Kneels)
  FREDERIC: Rise, sweet one, I have long pardoned you.  (Ruth
            rises)
  RUTH:     The two words were so much alike!
  FREDERIC: They were.  They still are, though years have rolled
            over their heads.  But this afternoon my obligation
            ceases.  Individually, I love you all with affection
            unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a
            disgust that amounts to absolute detestation.  Oh! pity
            me, my beloved friends, for such is my sense of duty
            that, once out of my indentures, I shall feel myself
            bound to devote myself heart and soul to your
            extermination!
  ALL:      Poor lad — poor lad!  (All weep)
  KING:     Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
            your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting
            on that conviction.  Always act in accordance with the
            dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the
            consequences.
  SAMUEL:   Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to
            remain with us.  We don't seem to make piracy pay.  I'm
            sure I don't know why, but we don't.
  FREDERIC: I know why, but, alas! I mustn't tell you; it wouldn't
            be right.

            Directions:  GIRLS and MAJOR-GENERAL go up rocks, while PIRATES indulge in a
            wild dance of delight on stage.  The MAJOR-GENERAL produces
            a British flag, and the PIRATE KING, in arched rock,
            produces a black flag with skull and crossbones.  Enter
            RUTH, who makes a final appeal to FREDERIC, who casts her
            from him. </pre></p>
