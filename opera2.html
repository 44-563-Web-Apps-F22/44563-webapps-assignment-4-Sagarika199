<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4>  <p class = "speech">Well, Ruth, I feel some difficulty about you.  It is
        true that I admire you very much, but I have been
        constantly at sea since I was eight years old, and
        yours is the only woman's face I have seen during that
        time.  I think it is a sweet face.</p>
<h4 class = "ruth">RUTH:</h4>  <p class = "speech">It is — oh, it is!</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4>  <p class = "speech">I say I think it is; that is my impression.  But as I
    have never had an opportunity of comparing you with
    other women, it is just possible I may be mistaken.</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4>  <p class = "speech">True.</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4>  <p class = "speech">What a terrible thing it would be if I were to marry
    this innocent person, and then find out that she is, on
    the whole, plain!</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4> <p class = "speech">Oh, Ruth is very well, very well indeed.</p> 
<h4 class = "sam">SAMUEL:</h4> <p class = "speech">Yes, there are the remains of a fine woman about Ruth.</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">Do you really think so?</p>
<h4 class = "sam">SAMUEL:</h4>  <p class = "speech">I do.</p> 
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">Then I will not be so selfish as to take her from you.
    In justice to her, and in consideration for you, I will
    leave her behind.  (Hands RUTH to KING)</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4><p class = "speech">No, Frederic, this must not be.  We are rough men, who
    lead a rough life, but we are not so utterly heartless
    as to deprive thee of thy love.  I think I am right in
    saying that there is not one here who would rob thee of
    this inestimable treasure for all the world holds dear.</p> 
<h4 class = "all">ALL:</h4> <p class = "speech">Not one!</p> <p class = "directions">(loudly)  </p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4><p class = "speech"> No, I thought there wasn't.  Keep thy love, Frederic,
    keep thy love. </p>  <p class = "directions">(Hands her back to FREDERIC)</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">You're very good, I'm sure.</p>  <p class = "directions">(Exit RUTH)</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4> <p class = "speech">Well, it's the top of the tide, and we must be off.
    Farewell, Frederic.  When your process of extermination
    begins, let our deaths be as swift and painless as you
    can conveniently make them.</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">I will!  By the love I have for you, I swear it!  Would
    that you could render this extermination unnecessary by
    accompanying me back to civilization!</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4> <p class = "speech">No, Frederic, it cannot be.  I don't think much of our
    profession, but, contrasted with respectability, it is
    comparatively honest.  No, Frederic, I shall live and
    die a Pirate King.</p>
        
                        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SONG — PIRATE KING</h4>

                               Oh, better far to live and die
                                Under the brave black flag I fly,
                                Than play a sanctimonious part
                                With a pirate head and a pirate heart.
                                Away to the cheating world go you,
                                Where pirates all are well-to-do;
                                But I'll be true to the song I sing,
                                And live and die a Pirate King.
                                For I am a Pirate King!
                                And it is, it is a glorious thing
                                To be a Pirate King!
                                For I am a Pirate King!</p>

                                When I sally forth to seek my prey
                                I help myself in a royal way.
                                I sink a few more ships, it's true,
                                Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;
                                But many a king on a first-class throne,
                                If he wants to call his crown his own,
                                Must manage somehow to get through
                                More dirty work than e'er I do,
                                For I am a Pirate King!
                                And it is, it is a glorious thing
                                To be a Pirate King!
