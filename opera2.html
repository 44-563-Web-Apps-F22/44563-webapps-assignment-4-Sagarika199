    keep thy love. </p>  <p1 class = "directions">(Hands her back to FREDERIC)</p1>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">You're very good, I'm sure.</p>  <p1 class = "directions">(Exit RUTH)</p1>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4> <p class = "speech">Well, it's the top of the tide, and we must be off.
    Farewell, Frederic.  When your process of extermination
    begins, let our deaths be as swift and painless as you
    can conveniently make them.</p>
<h4 class = "fred">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class = "speech">I will!  By the love I have for you, I swear it!  Would
    that you could render this extermination unnecessary by
    accompanying me back to civilization!</p>
<h4 class = "king">KING:</h4> <p class = "speech">No, Frederic, it cannot be.  I don't think much of our
    profession, but, contrasted with respectability, it is
    comparatively honest.  No, Frederic, I shall live and
    die a Pirate King.</p>

                               Oh, better far to live and die
                                Under the brave black flag I fly,
                                Than play a sanctimonious part
                                With a pirate head and a pirate heart.
                                Away to the cheating world go you,
                                Where pirates all are well-to-do;
                                But I'll be true to the song I sing,
                                And live and die a Pirate King.
                                For I am a Pirate King!
                                And it is, it is a glorious thing
                                To be a Pirate King!
                                For I am a Pirate King!</p>

                                When I sally forth to seek my prey
                                I help myself in a royal way.
                                I sink a few more ships, it's true,
                                Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;
                                But many a king on a first-class throne,
                                If he wants to call his crown his own,
                                Must manage somehow to get through
                                More dirty work than e'er I do,
                                For I am a Pirate King!
                                And it is, it is a glorious thing
                                To be a Pirate King!
